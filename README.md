# Passive
A synth based on TripleOscillator in LMMS. This synth is made in SynthMaker, and requires SynthMaker to use. I may provide a FL Studio Plugin version in the future.

Features:
- 3 oscillators with basic waveforms
  - Coarse detune
  - Fine pitch controls for L/R channels
  - Phase controls
- Toggleable oscillator modulation option
  - To be implemented :)
- ASDR volume envolope
- Moog-like lowpass filter with ASDR controls
